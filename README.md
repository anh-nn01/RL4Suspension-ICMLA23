* `config.py`: code containing configurations of vehicle's mechanical system (body mass, wheel mass, spring stiffness, etc); Neural Network architecture (number of neurons); training hyperparameters; and road excitation.
* `model.py`: Neural Network implementation for Q-Network (Critic) and Policy Network (Actor).
* `road_generator.py`: Python implementation of ISO-8608 random road profiles and simple sine-shape road for training and evaluation.
* `trainer.py`: Trainer to
  * (1) initialize Actor-Critic weights ($\theta_{\mu}$ & $\theta_{Q}$);
  * (2) sample buffered experience from the environment using Quarter Model ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation);
  * (3) back-propagate and optimize weights of Q-Network and Policy Network ($\nabla_{\theta_{Q}}$ & $\nabla_{\theta_{\mu}}$)
  * (4) update weights & save checkpoints.
* `execute_training.py`: contains implementation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, buffer stack, and code to execute the DDPG training framework.

Training and Evluation
----
To execute the training process, please use `execute_training.py`. 

Specifically, please change checkpoint names for Q-Network and Policy Network in `execute_training.py`, and run the following command:
```
  python3 execute_training.py
```

Once you train the model (or use our pretrained model), you may find the `evaluation.ipynb` notebook to be helpful. Specifically, it shows visualization of comparative performance between our proposed DDPG-based Active Suspension Control to Passive System as well as the dynamically controlled stiffness and damping coefficient.

Trained Models
----
To have a quick start, please use the pretrained Actor/Critic in folder `./checkpoints`. Since the final model performance is sensitive to initialized weights, you can use these weights as the initialization for experimenting new ideas.
